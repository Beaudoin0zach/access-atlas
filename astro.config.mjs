// Server-only config (Keycloak, the Supabase service-role key, the provisional
// gate) is read from process.env at RUNTIME so secrets never inline into the
// build — Vite only inlines import.meta.env, so a service-role key read that way
// would ship inside the container image. For local dev + build, mirror .env into
// process.env here. This config file does NOT run in the production standalone
// server (it gets real env from its host), so this affects local tooling only.
Object.assign(process.env, loadEnv(process.env.NODE_ENV ?? 'development', process.cwd(), ''));

// Public origin(s) this app is served from, for Astro's CSRF origin check.
//
// WHY THIS IS NEEDED. Astro's built-in `security.checkOrigin` (on by default for
// on-demand routes) rejects a form POST whose browser `Origin` header doesn't
// match the origin Astro computes for itself. Behind a TLS-terminating proxy —
// DO App Platform here — the container receives plain HTTP with the real host in
// `X-Forwarded-Host`/`X-Forwarded-Proto`. But Astro only TRUSTS those forwarded
// headers for hosts named in `security.allowedDomains`; with none configured it
// refuses the forwarded host and falls back to `localhost`, so it computes its
// origin as `https://localhost` while the browser sends `https://<real-host>`.
// Mismatch → "Cross-site POST form submissions are forbidden" on every POST.
// (Local `astro dev` is unaffected: the dev server doesn't run this validation.)
//
// The fix is to name the real host(s) so the forwarded headers are trusted — NOT
// to disable checkOrigin, which is the actual CSRF protection and, with a
// zero-JS surface (no client token scheme possible), the only layer there is.
//
// Patterns are HOSTNAME-ONLY on purpose. Adding a `protocol` field would route
// protocol-validation through a dummy `example.com` origin that never matches a
// real hostname, silently rejecting the forwarded proto and reintroducing the
// bug. Hostname-only trusts http/https via Astro's simple scheme check while
// still pinning the host exactly.
//
// Build-time (this file bakes it into the manifest), comma-separated, accepts
// full origins or bare hosts. Set SITE_ORIGINS at BUILD time on the host, e.g.
//   SITE_ORIGINS=https://accessatlas.org,access-atlas-xxxx.ondigitalocean.app
// Unset → empty → today's behavior preserved (correct for local dev, where host
// IS localhost). A public hostname is not a secret, so baking it does not touch
// the §6 no-secrets-in-the-image rule.
